## Key Trends Observed

### 1. Monday Morning Rush Hour Sentiment Drop
**Finding**: Sentiment polarity shows a noticeable drop during Monday morning rush hours (7-9 AM) compared to other weekdays.

**Implication**: Monday morning commutes are particularly stressful due to higher traffic volumes, weekend maintenance disruptions, and psychological "Monday morning" effects.

**Recommendation**: CTA should increase service frequency on Monday mornings and provide proactive communication about potential delays.

### 2. Negative Sentiment Correlates with 311 Complaints
**Finding**: Moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.3-0.4) between negative tweet sentiment and transit-related 311 complaints.

**Implication**: Social media sentiment serves as an early indicator of service issues. When sentiment becomes negative, official complaint channels see increased activity, suggesting both channels capture similar underlying problems.

**Recommendation**: Implement real-time sentiment monitoring as an early warning system and proactively address issues when sentiment trends negative.

### 3. Ridership and Sentiment Relationship
**Finding**: Weak to moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.2-0.3) between CTA ridership and sentiment polarity.

**Implication**: Higher ridership days tend to have slightly more positive sentiment, indicating that good service quality may lead to both higher ridership and better sentiment.

**Recommendation**: Consider sentiment as a service quality metric alongside traditional KPIs and investigate whether service improvements lead to both higher ridership and better sentiment.

### 4. Weekly Patterns
**Finding**: Sentiment is more positive on Fridays and weekends, while complaints peak mid-week (Tuesday-Thursday).

**Implication**: Mid-week service issues accumulate frustration, while weekend sentiment reflects leisure travel rather than commute stress.

**Recommendation**: Focus maintenance and improvements on mid-week periods and ensure service quality doesn't degrade as the week progresses.
